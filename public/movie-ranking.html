<h1>The Best Movies According To Marija</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>“Inception”'s premise is that dreams can be constructed, manipulated, and shared, a concept which attracts professional “extractors” who work to exploit these dreams to steal ideas from, or plant them into, a subject's head.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Set in a future where a failing Earth puts humanity on the brink of extinction, it sees an intrepid team of NASA scientists, engineers and pilots attempt to find a new habitable planet, via interstellar travel.</p>
<h3>Insidious</h3>
<p>Insidious is full of some of the best jump scares in horror history, none of which are predictable. Part of what makes Insidious' jump scares so horrifying is that they are not just visual jump scares. They're supported by loud sound effects and enough flashing lights to unnerve the most stolid constitutions.</p>
